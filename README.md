- **R Key**: Show robot's predicted shot
- **Tab**: Focus game canvas for keyboard controls

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser with HTML5 Canvas support
- Local web server (recommended for sound effects)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the files
2. If using Visual Studio Code, install the "Live Server" extension
3. Right-click `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server"

Alternatively, you can use any local web server:
```bash
# Using Python 3
python -m http.server

# Using Node.js
npx http-server
```
